# React-native sample
In this repo, I try testing [`react native`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and also provide some useful samples to reference in future.

- [x] **Integrate to available Android source**
  + Ref: [Facebook guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/integration-with-existing-apps.html). 
    + '../' is current prj dir
    + Need to start server, checking package.json, not start server, need to build bundle [`Bundle`](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/0.19/docs/running-on-device-ios.html)
    + Can config build path on build.gradle
    + Actually a switch point from Android to React-native is an pre-defined methods ReactActivity, then this activity will handle our React-native UI
